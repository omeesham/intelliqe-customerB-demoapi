 * BaseApi — the contract every service object extends.

 * encapsulates the selectors and interactions of one screen, a SERVICE OBJECT
 * encapsulates the requests of one endpoint or resource: the URL, the headers,
 * the payload. Specs talk to service objects, never to raw URLs — that is the
 * whole point: when the endpoint moves, its auth scheme changes or a header is
 * added, you fix one service object, not dozens of tests.
 *
 * Generated service objects look like:
 *
 *   export class UsersApi extends BaseApi {
 *     async listUsers(): Promise<APIResponse> {
 *       return this.send('GET', 'https://api.example.com/v1/users', {
 *         headers: { Accept: 'application/json' },
